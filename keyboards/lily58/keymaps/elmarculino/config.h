 * Magic Key Options
 *
 * Magic keys are hotkey commands that allow control over firmware functions of
 * the keyboard. They are best used in combination with the HID Listen program,
 * found here: https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/hid_listen.html
 *
 * The options below allow the magic key functionality to be changed. This is
 * useful if your keyboard/keypad is missing keys and you want magic key support.
